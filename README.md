# Traffic Network Simulator
A command-line traffic network simulator built in C++ that models roads as an undirected graph with weighted edges representing distance, speed, and traffic congestion. Users can insert roads, simulate traffic conditions, load road data from files, and compute shortest travel times or optimal paths using a Dijkstra-based algorithm.
